I'm a Full-Stack Developer from Los Angeles, CA.  I've dabbled with programming many years ago, for classwork and small personal projects.  It wasn't until COVID hit, when I took on formal training in Amazon Technical Academy, where I learned Java and software engineering principles.  Later, I became an apprentice for them for a few months, gaining valuable insight into DevOps.  Since then, I've expanded my knowledge and skills through bootcamps.  My knowledge now include Node, Express, React, Postgres, Python, Flask, and Java.  With a preference for back-end development, my aim is to help reduce time and cost for people.
